## 🚦 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

See [deployment notes](#%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8Fdeployment) on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 🔑 Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for building, running, and testing the Standup Raven.

#### 👨‍💻 Obtaining Source

    $ go get -u github.com/standup-raven/standup-raven/server

#### Go

    https://golang.org/doc/install
    
#### NodeJS

    https://nodejs.org/download/release/v10.11.0/

#### Make

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    
On MacOS, install XCode command line tools. 

#### HTTPie

You need this only if you want to use `$ make deploy` for deployments to Mattermost instance.

### 👨‍💻 Building

Once you have fetched the repo via `go get`, simply run `$ make dist` from the repo.

This will produce three artifacts in `/dist` directory -
